I have been (graciously) trained in [[Bharatanatyam]] for about 10+ years and yet I struggle to perfect it (obviously). To everyone asking “If you have been learning the dance form for **this** long, have you finished your first stage performance (_[[arangetram]]_)?”, I am sorry to say but my answer is no and may probably remain no in the future too!
I really do not find the need to do such a grand stage performance in order to learn/excel in the artform (I know, a very controversial and unpopular opinion).
