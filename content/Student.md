Where and what do I study?
	I study about Particles, Strings and Cosmology in Durham University at Durham, United Kingdom.
I write my academic notes in [[My Journey with Physics|My Journey with Physics]] and also some other random jazz :P

I was a student (continue to be one) at [[Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning]], which I claim to be the best 3 years of my existence. I have documented my experience as a student in that hallowed institution and my learnings from that.
