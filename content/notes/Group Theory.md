## What is a Group?
	A group is a set of elements along with an operation that satisfies the following:
	1.  Closure
	2. Associativity
	3. Existence of Identity
	4. Invertibility of elements
Can be classified into [[Discrete]] and [[Continuous Groups]].
### A group is defined to be finite iff it has a finite number of elements (duh). This number is called the order of the group.
### A group is called [[abelian]] if all the elements commute with each other under the group operation. Otherwise, they are called [[non-abelian]].
