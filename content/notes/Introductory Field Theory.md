A subject that I understood 0% of since lecture 1 and yet, making “notes”!
## Why?
1. I did not learn these conventions in my undergrad and so was unprepared for all that was covered in the first week.
2. The lecturer speaks in his own European accent and to himself, which quite adds to my discomfort with the subject.
3. Almost 80% of my class are research students and hence he just assumes that everyone “knows” few concepts and moves on.
