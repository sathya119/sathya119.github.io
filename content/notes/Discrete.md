First, what is a multiplication table. It basically is a table that shows all possible combinations of the elements under the group operation.
(insert drawing here)
Example:
	Group of integers under addition modulo 3.$$Z_3 = {e,a,b}$$
As the name suggests, discrete groups are those in which the elements have a defined spacing between each other.
