1. Introduction
	1. Principle of Equivalence
		The **gravitational force** is **equivalent** to being in an **accelerated frame of reference.**
		In official terms: “The effects of a **gravitational field** are in principle **locally indistinguishable** from being in an **accelerated frame**”
			So, in Newtonian gravitational theory, the very fact that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal was unexplained. So entered Einstein with his “Elevator” thought experiment.
				If you’re in a windowless cabin, apparently feeling some universal force, there’s no way for you to tell if you’re in an accelerating reference frame (say, a rocket ship in deep space) or in a gravitational field (sitting in a lab).
		Gravitation is just an effect of being in a non-inertial frame. Bodies that feel gravity just move freely, i.e., are in inertial motion.
		**BUT!** The motion of say a planet looks very different from the usual ideas of inertial motion.
			Hence came up a new concept of inertial motion, by changing the geometry of spacetime. (Straight lines now become **Geodesics** - Straightest possible lines in that geometry)
