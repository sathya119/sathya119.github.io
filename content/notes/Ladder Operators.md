$$H = \frac{P^2}{2m} + \frac{m\omega^2X^2}{2}$$
where X and P are the position and momentum operators respectively.
Let us introduce the creation and annihilation operators such that, $$[a,a^\dagger] = 1$$
and we write ansatz for X and P in terms of the ladder operators as,$$X = (a+a^\dagger)C$$
$$P = i\hbar(a-a^\dagger)B$$
Then, $$[X,P] = -2i\hbar BC$$
and to recover the commutation to be iℏ, we require -2BC = 1
Further, we can fix the Hamiltonian to have the form, $$H = (\frac{1}{2m}(-B^2\hbar^2)(a^2 + (a^\dagger)^2-\{a,a^\dagger\}))\hbar+\frac{m\omega^2}{2}(C^2)(a^2 + (a^\dagger)^2+\{a,a^\dagger\})\hbar$$
$$=E(\{a,a^\dagger\})=E(aa^\dagger+\frac{1}{2})\hbar$$
Hence, using these two equations, we can solve for B and C obtaining, $$X=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}(a+a^\dagger)$$
$$P=-i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar m\omega}{2}}(a-a^\dagger)$$
We also obtain a relation E = ℏω, i.e., $$H=\hbar\omega(aa^\dagger+\frac{1}{2})$$
Hence, we interpret these ladder operators as creating and destroying quanta since, $$[H,a^\dagger]=\hbar\omega a^\dagger$$
$$[H,a]=-\hbar\omega a$$
Note: $$a\ket{0}=0$$
