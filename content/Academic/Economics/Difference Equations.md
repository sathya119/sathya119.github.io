- [[Differential Equations]] are for continuous functions and their derivatives, $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$
- what about discretely increasing (step-wise) functions?

Now, consider the function,
$$
I_{2024} = f(Y_{2023})
$$
Here, investment, $I$ is the dependent variable in 2024, and we have a lagged (2023) in dependent variable, income $Y$.

- when we take time as a continuous variable then we need to use a [[Differential Equations]], but when we use time as a discrete variable, we need to use a [[Difference Equations]].

By solving difference equation, our objective is to find the [[time path]]. The solution should be a function of time and must not contain any [[Difference Expression]]

# Drawing the [[time path]]

There are four cases:
## 1. $b > 1$

- grows exponentially

## 2. $b = 0$

- Shrinks to zero at once.

## 3. $0\lt b \lt 1$

- dampening and converging


![[Difference Equations 2024-09-23 09.59.13.excalidraw.light.svg]]

## 4. $-1\lt b \lt 0$

- dampening and oscillating -> converting to $0$

After seeing 7 situations, there are four observations

| If              | Then                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| $\|{b}\| \gt 1$ | Time path explodes          |
| $\|b\|\lt 1$    | Time path converges         |
| $b\gt 0$        | Time path doesn’t oscillate |
| $b \lt 0$       | Time path oscillates        |
